# Implementation of A2C and A3C Algorithms
This project implements and compares the Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic (A3C) algorithms using the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym . The focus is on understanding the difference between synchronous and asynchronous policy gradient methods and evaluating their performance in discrete environments.
# Environment: CartPole-v1 (Discrete Control)
The CartPole environment is one of the most classic control tasks in reinforcement learning.
A pole is attached by an un-actuated joint to a cart that moves along a track.
The goal of the agent is to prevent the pole from falling by moving the cart left or right.
