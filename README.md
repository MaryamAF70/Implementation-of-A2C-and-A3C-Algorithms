# Implementation-of-A2C-and-A3C-Algorithms
This project implements and compares the Advantage Actor–Critic (A2C) and Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic (A3C) algorithms using the CartPole-v1 environment from OpenAI Gym . The focus is on understanding the difference between synchronous and asynchronous policy gradient methods and evaluating their performance in discrete environments.
